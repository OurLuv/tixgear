Plugin for adding event/product cards in the Gutenberg editor for sale and integration with the TixGear's API
== Description ==
This plugin allows anyone who sells tickets through the world-famous ticket platform TixGear to sell them through your Wordpress site.
The plugin adds a block in the Gutenberg editor that automatically generates event or product cards (depending on what you are selling) based on your fid and token in the platform

== Installation and Usage==
This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.
- Upload the plugin files to the directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
- Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ screen in WordPress
- After activating the plugin, you will be able to add the "TixGear" block to your page in the standard Wordpress editor.
- After adding the block, you will need to enter the fid and token and specify the zone - test or real (these fields are visible only in the editor and they are not on the page itself). You can click the "Submit" button and check whether events with these parameters appear.

Don't forget to save the changes on the page

P.S. You can use standart parameters to check how it's working:
